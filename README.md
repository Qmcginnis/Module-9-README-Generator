## Installation
    
  _Follow these steps to properly install this application:_
  For installing this app you will run npm install from your CLI, inquirer, fs, and util. This will allow the question prompts from the CLI for you to create your README.md
      
## Usage
  _Instructions for use:_
  Run the command node index.js in the CLI and the inquirer package will begin prompts for your README section information. As you answer each question you dynamically form the sections, and table of contents for your README.
